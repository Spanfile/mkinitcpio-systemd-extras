This hook enables a service delaying boot until /etc/hold is deleted.

This may come in handy in case you want to perform some action on your root
file system (e.g. backup, encryption) without a running system already using
this root file system.

Mind that to proceed with the boot process you have to delete /etc/hold in your
initramfs, i.e. some kind of access to the initramfs is required. The
mkinitcpio hooks sd-tinyssh and sd-network enable access via SSH.
